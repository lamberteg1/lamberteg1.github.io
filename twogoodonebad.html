    <h1>Two good, One Bad </h1>

    <h2> Good # 1: University of Washington</h2>
    <a href="https://www.washington.edu/"> University of Washington</a>
    <p> I really liked this website for a few reasons. Fors one, it is just visibly pleasing. There is a good number of images that are engaging without being overwhelming. The navigation was also straightforward. I appreciated how at the very top there was a navigation bar that first let you choose your affiliation with the college – student, parent, staff, or alumni. Once you click on your preference, you have a home page that is customized to you. The second navigation bar is also clear, it gives you options such as apply, events, and giving. Pretty much anything that someone could be visiting a college website for was clearly laid out. The main colors were purple and white. The colors looked nice together, for there was a pop of color without being overwhelming. It also made sense, since University of Washington’s colors are purple and gold. They also use cute little icons, such as a movie ticket for their arts page, a trophy for athletics, and a book for libraries. They have a “fast facts” section which is something different that helped showcase how successful the college is. As far as coding goes, I recognized most of it. They used HTMLBodyElement, HTMLElement, font family, and background color for instance. I did not recognize the property Node or EventTarget</p>
    <h2> Good # 2: Visit Montana </h2>
    <a href="https://www.visitmt.com/"> Visit Montana</a>
    <p> What I found to be unique about this website was that towards the bottom of the home page there were pictures in Montana taken from social media users who tagged Visit Montana. I thought this was a cool way to showcase the drawn of Montana because you see regular people out having a blast in the great outdoors. Plus, I imagine it is pretty cool for the photographer to see their picture on an official and well-trafficked website. All the images used on the site were so picturesque and really highlighted the beauty of the state, which I think really engages those who visit the site. The main colors were a sage green and white, which I thought was a good fit. Had it been a bright green, it would have been too much given the amount of images used, but the green is also an outdoor color so it fit the theme. The navigation bar was pretty basic, with just search, help, and share. However, there was a menu bar on the side, which I thought worked well with the layout because it kept the page from looking too crowded. The menu I feel did a good job of covering anything you would be looking for if you were planning a visit to Montana, such as places to go, things to do, and places to stay. This coding used Javascipt, which we have no learned yet. This website also used scrolling and table elements (which I know how to do now :) ). </p>
    <h2> Bad # 1: James Bond Museum </h2>
    <a href="https://www.007museum.com/"> 007 Museum</a>
    <p>I do not even know where to begin with this page. They layout was all over the place and there was no navigation. Due to this, you have to keep scrolling for what feels like forever, and you have no idea what information they have, you just have to scroll and hope for the best (and that your hand does not cramp). There is also no organization to the layout. The display when you first click into the site is all over the place and your eyes do not know where to focus. There is a random mix of pictures, icons, and texts. The main colors first appear to be black and red, which admittedly would have worked well with the 007 theme, but once you start scrolling it is just a white background with black and blue text. This looks like no effort whatsoever was put into designing the website and there is information overload because of how crowded and unorganized everything is. Given the fact that this was a poorly done website, the coding was incredibly basic. They had paragraphs and alignment to both the center and left but there really is not anything worth commenting on in their code. There are a few tables used, but most of the code is just paragraphs and images with a border around them. Not to mention, the webiste is not secure and my computer always warms me about going to the website. This could prevent people from viewing the site and ineracting with it.
