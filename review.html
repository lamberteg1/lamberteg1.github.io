        <h1>Emma's Web Hosting Review</h1>
        <p> The following websites are web hosts providers. This page will compare and contrast the different features and costs of Fat Cow, GoDaddy, and HostGator.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.fatcow.com/"target="_new">Fat Cow</a></h2>
        <p>Fat cow offers a free domain name, easy blog set up, site templates, unlmited mailboxes, disk space and bandwidth, and a free website builder for their hosting services. For domain services, they have 369 new domains available, registration on a first come first serve basis, pre-registration, an early access period, priority pre-registration, and trademark holders. You can sign up for a one month term ($14.95 monthly), a year term ($14.95 monthly), a two year term ($13.95 monthly), or a 36 month term ($12.95).  </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_new">GoDaddy</a></h2>
        <p>For hosting services, GoDaddy provides over 125 free applications to explore, one GB of storage, 24/7 security monitoring, flexible control panels, and help with setup for GoDaddy registered domains. For domain services, GoDaddy offers up to 100 subdomains, real time monitoring, tools to forward to any existing website, simple domain set up, and world class support from web professionals. Different options on this site included economy, deluxe, ultimate, and maximum. Economy ($5.99 monthly) incldueds the basic resources, deluxe ($7.99 monthly) has more space and flexiblity for multiple sites, the ultiamte package ($12.99) has more power for complex sites and heavy traffic, and the maximum ($19.99) allows for mulitple complex sites, more power and space, and high resolution photos and videos.  </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" target="_new">Host Gator </a></h2>
        <p>The final web host I am looking at is Host Gator. This web host provides flexible control, unmetered bandwith, unlmited subdomains, SSL certification and does not require a contract for its hosting services. For domain services, Host Gator offers domain locking, domain renwal, easy management, and domain privacy protection. Different options under this provider are the hatching plan ($2.75 monthly) which has a single domain, free website transfers, unmetered bandwidth and an SSL certificate. The next option is the baby plan ($3.95) which includes the previous features but unlimited domains, and lastly there is the business plan ($5.95) wich includes the aformentioned plus SEO tools, free dedicated IP, and a free upgrade to Postitive SSL.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After looking into these three web host provides, if I were to pick one, I would choose GoDaddy. Their pricing was not as exepnsive as some of the other providers and they still offered good security, storage, and plenty of tools to help the customer with their needs. </p>
