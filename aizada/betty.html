                Betty is a mother of five boys living in Kenya's Rift Valley Province. Her parents died when she was 14 years old. Being the first born in the family, she had to stop schooling so that she could take care of her siblings. </p>
            <p>

                Having no other option to raise money for her siblings, she was married at the age of 17. She is currently living alone together with her children and puts most of her efforts into providing for them and funding their education. Due to financial challenges, her first born was unable to finish up his secondary education, and her second child had vision problems, putting a stop to his education. </p>

            <p> While working as a masseuse, she met Paula, a fair trade store owner from Montana. Paula offered to help sell Betty's jewelry and her last three kids are continuing with their education due to the jewelry making business. </p>

            <p> "This activity has enabled me to at least get some cash to take my last three children to school and also have something to eat regardless of fluctuation of the demand from the available local markets. I enjoy jewelry making for the way God has used it to sustain my family. If I was just to sit doing nothing, my children couldn't have gone to school and also life would have been much difficult. Getting someone to expand my business such as getting international customers will enable me see my plans and dreams being fulfilled in my life." - Betty
