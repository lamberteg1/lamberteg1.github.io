            <h1> Spring </h1>
            <p> Gerard Manley Hopkins </p>
            <img src="spring-tree.png" class="tree">
            <p>Nothing is so beautiful as Spring –

                When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;

                Thrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush

                Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring

                The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;

                The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush

                The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush

                With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.



                What is all this juice and all this joy?

                A strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning

                In Eden garden. – Have, get, before it cloy,

                Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,

                Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,
                Most, O maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the winning. </p>
            <h1> Lines Written in Early Spring </h1>
            <p> William Wordworth <p>
                    <p> I heard a thousand blended notes,
                        While in a grove I sate reclined,
                        In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
                        Bring sad thoughts to the mind.



                        To her fair works did Nature link
                        The human soul that through me ran;
                        And much it grieved my heart to think
                        What man has made of man.

                        Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
                        The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
                        And ’tis my faith that every flower
                        Enjoys the air it breathes.

                        The birds around me hopped and played,
                        Their thoughts I cannot measure:—
                        But the least motion which they made
                        It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

                        The budding twigs spread out their fan,
                        To catch the breezy air;
                        And I must think, do all I can,
                        That there was pleasure there.

                        If this belief from heaven be sent,
                        If such be Nature’s holy plan,
                        Have I not reason to lament
                        What man has made of man? </p>
