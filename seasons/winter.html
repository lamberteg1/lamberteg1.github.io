            <h1> Snow </h1>
            <p> Gillian Clarke </p>
            <img src="winter-tree.png" class="tree">
            <p>The dreamed Christmas,
                flakes shaken out of silences so far
                and starry we can’t sleep for listening
                for papery rustles out there in the night
                and wake to find our ceiling glimmering,
                the day a psaltery of light.

                So we’re out over the snow fields
                before it’s all seen off with a salt-lick
                of Atlantic air, then home at dusk, snow-blind
                from following chains of fox and crow and hare,
                to a fire, a roasting bird, a ringing phone,
                and voices wondering where we are.

                A day foretold by images
                of glassy pond, peasant and snowy roof
                over the holy child iconed in gold.
                Or women shawled against the goosedown air
                pleading with soldiers at a shifting frontier
                in the snows of television,

                while in the secret dark a fresh snow falls
                filling our tracks with stars.</p>
            <h1> A Winter Bluejay </h1>
            <p> Sara Teasdale <p>
                    <p> Crisply the bright snow whispered,
                        Crunching beneath our feet;
                        Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
                        Our shadows danced,
                        Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
                        Across the lake the skaters
                        Flew to and fro,
                        With sharp turns weaving
                        A frail invisible net.
                        In ecstasy the earth
                        Drank the silver sunlight;
                        In ecstasy the skaters
                        Drank the wine of speed;
                        In ecstasy we laughed
                        Drinking the wine of love.
                        Had not the music of our joy
                        Sounded its highest note?
                        But no,
                        For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
                        “Oh look!”
                        There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
                        Fearless and gay as our love,
                        A bluejay cocked his crest!
                        Oh who can tell the range of joy
                        Or set the bounds of beauty?.</p>
