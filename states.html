    <title> Review of State Websites </title>

    <h1> <a href="https://www.vermont.gov"> #1 Vermont </a> </h1>

    <body>Vermont had to be my favorite page out of the five websites. The home page had plenty of nice images and personalized pictures that showcased the beauty of the state. Their main colors we nice as well, for they were neutral but also different than the generic blues you normally see on professional websites. The page loaded without lag and I found the website really user-friendly and actually enjoyed reading some of their content. The site also worked well on the mobile site and I found it to be very interactive for a government website. </body>

    <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/"> #2 Iowa </a></h1>

    <body> Iowa’s page at first did not seem as eye catching as the others because there was no standout image on the page. The more I started interacting with it, however, the more I found the platform more playful and fun. The page was colorful, and the layout was done in a way where the viewer of the site was not overwhelmed with mass amounts of information while still being able to find the information needed. The layout was not as well formatted on my phone though, and I had to do a lot of scrolling to get anywhere on the site. Also, the pages that branched off the home page were not as nicely designed in terms of aesthetic appeal. </body>

    <h1>
        <a href="https://alaska.gov"> #3 Alaska </a>
    </h1>

    <body> On Alaska’s home page there is a nice panel image of a mountain which I liked and probably makes Alaska’s residents identify better with the page. There was a lot of blue, which is a pretty common color to use on official websites. I found the site to be easy to navigate, though there was a lot of information to sort through and the site looked a little busy. Given the large amount of information, however, the site loaded relatively quickly. When opened on my phone, the website fit the screen and worked well. All the images loaded, and the links worked.</body>

    <h1> <a href="https://www.tn.gov"> #4 Tennessee </a> </h1>

    <body> Tennessee’s page had a lot of pictures, which I appreciated. I did find one branch on their website where the page did not load so I was not very impressed with that, but everything else loaded fine. The main color here was blue, which as mentioned, is a fairly common design color to use. I actually like this website more on my phone, it seemed more organized and less busy since instead of spreading out, it was layered down. Overall, there was nothing wrong with the page, but nothing really made it stand out to me. </body>

    <h1> <a href="https://www.ok.gov"> #5 Oklahoma </a></h1>

    <body> Oklahoma’s site was a little boring in my opinion. The dropdown menu was hard to find because it was so small at the very top of the page. The layout though was simple and easy to navigate as a result. The page loaded quickly as well, and the mobile site was also boring but accomplished everything it needed to do.</body>
